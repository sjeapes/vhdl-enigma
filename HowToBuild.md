# Toolchain #
Altera QuartusII toolchain and Altera MaxV part will be the initial parts used in development.
The decision is purely arbitrary and down to the author's experience with the tools. Since the code is intended to be device-agnostic the toolchain and device may be changed at the point of implementing a full machine.

(The free edition) of QuartusII can be obtained http://www.altera.com/products/software/quartus-ii/web-edition/qts-we-index.html on the Altera QuartusII download page.
