#summary An Overview of the design for the circuit board
#labels Phase-Design

= Requirements / Intentions =

 * Cheap - Sub $50, ideally sub $30
 * Hand-soldering possible
 * Any accessories (e.g. for input or power) should be commonly available and inexpensive (<$10 cost for extras)

= Design =

== Power ==
Won't just use DC-brick unless it's a common connector
Do not intend to supply PSU - adds too many complications with regions and safety implications


 * Micro USB
 * 


== Input ==

Options
 * PS/2 Keyboard
 * Switches
 * Capacitative Buttons
 * Serial Port


== Output ==

 * Serial Port
 * LCD
 * Individual (x26) LEDs


== CPLD ==

No BGA parts - TQFP to be used

(1) Internal Oscillator reduces cost
(2) More power rails require more regulators to supply them which will increase cost
