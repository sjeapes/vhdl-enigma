#summary An Overview of the design for the circuit board
#labels Phase-Design

= Requirements / Intentions =

 * Cheap - Sub $50, ideally sub $30
 * Hand-soldering possible
 * Any accessories (e.g. for input or power) should be commonly available and inexpensive (<$10 cost for extras)

= Design =

Elements Required:
 * Power Supply Input
 * Local Regulation
 * Input Method
 * CPLD
 * Output Method
 * Fixing/Tooling holes
 * Programming interface
 * 

== Power ==
Won't just use DC-brick unless it's a common connector
Do not intend to supply PSU - adds too many complications with regions and safety implications


 * Micro USB
 * Battery
   * PP3
   * AA
 * External + Battery?


== Input ==

Options
 * PS/2 Keyboard
 * Switches
 * Capacitative Buttons
 * Serial Port


== Output ==

 * Serial Port
 * LCD
 * Individual (x26) LEDs


== CPLD ==

No BGA parts - TQFP to be used
Estimated Logic requirements is TBD
Number of pins required is TBD (number of pins unlikely to be a restricting factor on part selection)

|| Feature || Altera Max II/V || Lattice Mach-X02 || Xilinx CoolRunnerII ||
|| Free Design S/W - Windows + Linux || Y || Y || *N* (3)||
|| TQFP Package    || Y || Y || - (4) ||
|| RS Cost /unit (~1270LUT) (1)  || 23.36GBP || 8.04GBP || - (4) ||
|| Power Req(2)    || 3.3V / 1.8V & 3.3V || 3.3V || -(4)||

(1) Price of smallest ~1270LUT, TQFP package device on the UK RS website. All other chip options ignored and cheapest available for a single part selected. Prices correct as of 27-Jul-13
(2) More power rails require more regulators to supply them which will increase cost
(3) Zync devices only on Free edition?
(4) Xilinx ruled out due to lack of free software

===Other Notes===
*Altera*

Altera device has internal oscillator which could be used avoiding the need for an external device

Dev Kit cost - $74.95


*Lattice*
Free IP available (providing Lattice devices are used. IP Includes
 * 8-bit and bigger soft-core processors
 * I2C master & slave

Hard-IP (timers, I2C) in MachX02 Parts

MachX02 device has internal oscillator which could be used avoiding the need for an external device

If the design is small enough there is also the ice40 range

Dev Kit cost - $42.88 (Pico dev kit)
Dev kit includes FTDI chips to allow serial link to chip, capacitive buttons (x4) and a small LCD screen for output.

*Xilinx*
Seemingly there is no free S/W available for the Cool-runner devices. This rules Xilinx Out


===Final Selection===

Lattice MachX02 with a view to migrate to the ice40 parts if resources permit
