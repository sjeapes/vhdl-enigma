= Introduction =

This page is intended to link to some useful VHDL resources and set out the coding style required

= Coding Style =

A coding style guide will be linked to which should be followed (but unlikely to be rigidly enforced provided the code is readable and working)

There are a couple of additional requirements
 * Code must be synthesize-able
 * Code must be device agnostic (e.g. no use of Altera specific IP)
 * Code must use Doxygen style comments for automatic document generation
